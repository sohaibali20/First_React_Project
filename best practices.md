- Files name should be start from uppercase letters

## If you are using Core React
- Always use js files where only java script is used.
- Always use jsx files when a java script also returns html code.
- Always use Uppercase first letter for function in components.

*Additional Notes*
- Only One Component can be return in one function. [**se Fragment or Div if if you want to call different components in one function**]
